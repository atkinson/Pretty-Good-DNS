(Caveat: my dns is hosted by my registrar; I am currently happy with them and not looking to switch.)
Recaptcha would protect my account how? If you mean I have to pass a recaptcha in addition to providing my username+password when I log in, then (a) I don't see that this adds much security; and (b) the presence of the captcha would put me off using your service.
I like the idea of sms authentication for making dns changes.
Does where name servers are make any difference? Surely what matters is where your company is based? (If you have a good answer to this, you should put it in your faq.)
Something I'd like to see as an option on this sort of technical webapp, is that as an ALTERNATIVE to the webapp I can ssh in and use a curses app to change settings, using a private key to authenticate myself, and disable use of the webapp for managing my account. (You might implement this using a suitably restricted curses-based web browser, that's not the point. The point is that I don't need to manage yet another password for a service I will not login to frequently.)
Not being able to register domains would be a minus point.
